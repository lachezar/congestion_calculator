- Should the application persist crossing events and taxation events in the database and then run the calculation at the end of the month?
- Should the input to the application contain the registration number and then the application can query other system for the actual vehicle type?
- Should the calculation be bounded in a time frame instead of calculating all tax events for all possible dates? (e.g. startDate / endDate in the request)

Please, take a look at the sections "Code structure", "Main concepts" and "What is missing from the project" in the README.md for more information.
